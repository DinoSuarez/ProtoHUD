----// Description //----

Basically, this is a piece of code for a heads-up display, to be used in a protogen helm. I want to have some additional data
about the environment that is visible from inside the helmet, such as temperature/ humidity, and the current time.
This code should be fairly lightweight and modular, but will likely end up being ESP-specific for however I implement
the time-query function.
